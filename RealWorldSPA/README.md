# Description
This folder contains the built elm code from [Richard Feldman's Elm-SPA-Example repo](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example).

Since it is intended to mimic a real world application, it should give the most interesting results.

The SPA routing is done with hashes, so it can be run by opening index.html directly.

A prepacked version will be here eventually, I hope!

# Issues
prepack 0.2.2 fails on `elm.js`.

```
SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /(?!/: Unterminated group
```
